# Gesture-Based Video Game Control using MediaPipe and OpenCV üéÆüñêÔ∏è

## Introduction

I am excited to share my latest project: **Gesture-Based Video Game Control** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**! This project allows gamers to control video games using simple hand gestures, replacing traditional keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D) with natural, intuitive movements.

## Inspiration

A week ago, while surfing through reels, I stumbled upon a video showcasing the power of the MediaPipe framework in recognizing hand movements. This sparked the idea for this project. I researched the concepts and developed this project.

Initially, I wanted to build CNN and other neural network models to detect gestures based on the 21 key points returned by the MediaPipe framework. However, this approach required high computational power and time to build the complex model. Instead, I analyzed the changes in the coordinates (x and y dimensions) of the points myself and developed the gesture detection mechanism.

## Project Highlights

- **Hand Detection and Tracking**: Leveraging MediaPipe for accurate and efficient hand landmark detection and tracking.
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Utilizing OpenCV to process video input from a webcam and interpret specific hand gestures to control game movements.
- **Smooth Integration**: Seamlessly mapping gestures to game commands, providing an intuitive and responsive gaming experience.

## Why This Matters

The integration of gesture-based controls can transform the way we interact with digital environments, making technology more accessible and engaging. This project showcases the potential for innovative user interfaces beyond conventional methods.

## How It Works

1. **Capture Video Input**: Using OpenCV to capture real-time video from a webcam.
2. **Process Hand Landmarks**: Applying MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
3. **Interpret Gestures**: Mapping detected gestures to specific game controls (W, A, S, D).
4. **Control the Game**: Translating gestures into game movements for an immersive experience.

## Future Possibilities

This is version 1.0. In future iterations, I plan to use neural models for better gesture detection and integrate more complex gestures for a more interactive experience.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

pip install mediapipe 
pip install opencv-python
## Usage

Clone the repository and run the script:

git clone https://github.com/saikesav-sai/hand_gesture_based_control.git
cd hand_gesture_based_control
hand_gesture_detection.ipynb

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to the developers of MediaPipe and OpenCV for creating such powerful tools. Also, thanks to the article: "Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow & OpenCV" by TechVidvan, which helped me to understand the implementation of gesture detection.
